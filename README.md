## PHP FROM SCRATCH 
### Love 2 Learn - PHP Learning Project

Welcome to my personal coding project! This repository is dedicated to improving my web development skills, with a strong focus on mastering PHP and related technologies. The goal is to become proficient in PHP, understand databases, front-end development, and the MVC architecture, all while building a solid foundation for full-stack web development.

---

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- **Master PHP**: Become a PHP pro by writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.
- **Learn Databases**: Understand how to integrate and work with databases (e.g., MySQL).
- **Front-End Skills**: Improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **MVC Architecture**: Implement the Model-View-Controller pattern to organize code effectively.
- **No Frameworks**: Focus on raw PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a strong foundation. However, Composer packages, JavaScript libraries, and SASS may be used as needed.
- **Containerization**: Use **DDEV** to containerize the application for easy setup and development.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Raw PHP
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL (or any relational database)
- **Tools**:
  - **DDEV**: For local development and containerization.
  - **Composer**: For managing PHP dependencies.
  - **SASS**: Optional, for styling (if needed).
  - **JavaScript Libraries**: As required for front-end functionality.
- **Version Control**: Git
